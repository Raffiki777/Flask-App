The sole purpose of this app is to demostrate the most basic use case of the Flask framework and how Flask can be used to create flexible webs.

Flask is an essential framework for web development, especially for beginners and developers looking for flexibility. Here's a brief summary of its importance:

Lightweight and Flexible:
Flask is a microframework, meaning it provides the basics without imposing strict rules. This makes it ideal for small projects or developers who want full control over their application structure.

Ease of Learning:
With its simple syntax and minimal setup, Flask is beginner-friendly and a great way to dive into web development.

Customizability:
Unlike larger frameworks, Flask allows you to add only the features you need through extensions, making it versatile and adaptable.

Rapid Development:
Flask’s minimalism enables quick prototyping and development, making it perfect for testing ideas or building MVPs (Minimum Viable Products).

Community Support:
Flask has an active and helpful community, providing extensive resources, documentation, and extensions to ease development.

Wide Range of Applications:
It’s used for building APIs, web apps, data visualization tools, and even backend services for more complex systems.

By leveraging Flask, you can efficiently build web applications tailored to your needs while enhancing your understanding of web frameworks and Python.
